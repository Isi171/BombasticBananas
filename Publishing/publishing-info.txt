Run with your fingers over the countryside!

Imagine this: you're a child again, it's the sunset, and you're riding in the back of your parents car. You imagine you can run with your fingers over the countryside...

You can jump from the guardrail to the mountains. Then, if you jump high enough in the sky, you can start flying.
